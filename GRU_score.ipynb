Inky, darkest-of-night blackness. Sucking the light in, perhaps. A toffee-colored layer of thick, long-lasting, and lace-producing head remains perched atop the ink below it. Aromas are heavenly...a mixture of milk chocolate, espresso, caramel, roasted malt. The flavor carries all of this as well. Splashes of chocolate and caramel initially, the middle sees some of the chewy grains, with a co-op of ABV and choco-bitterness at the end (what a finish!).

Worse by FAR when it gets a little warm, this is one I'd definitely avoid.\t\tIf you're poor or already drunk, maybe worth a shot... otherwise, buyer beware, and if you're that hard up grab a Molson Export, a Labatt or even a Budweiser to avoid this stuff. Cheers.\n",

      "Today we are drinking two beers. Why? No idea. But who cares its beer! The first beer we are drinking today is a Fat Dog stout from Stoudts Brewing Company. The label is awesome; the dog is so cute. There really is a fat dog! Anyway, this beer has a HUGE ABV, coming in at 9%. The beer is actually an imperial oatmeal stout, and I am not normally a big fan of an imperial stout. Lets see what this one has in store.\t\tIn the Glass: In the glass, its dark. It almost looks like a cola. The head is actually pretty similar to that of a soda too. Its light, with not much definition. You cant see through the glass, but the beer doesnt look thick. Lets see what it smells like.\t\tNose: The nose is soft and subtle, and has a certain sweetness to it. Some of the oatmeal stouts that I have had dont really smell like a stout. Now this one smells like a stout. I wonder what it tastes like.\t\tFlavor: The flavor in this beer is HUGE. Oh man, its so good. The sweetness is pretty obvious and there is a ton of carbonation on the back of the palate as the beer slides down your throat. It isnt think at all, and doesnt really taste like a stout. It has a much smoother flavor than you would expect from a beer like this.\t\tMouthfeel: The mouthfeel is amazing. Its starts without much, then the carbonation comes in. Then, as the beer slides down you get that overwhelming stout flavor. The beer just continues to impress one sip after another. And the thing is, the high ABV isnt obvious. You dont notice it at all really. Oh man, I like this beer!\t\tAftertaste: The aftertaste is long and dry and leaves that obvious stout aftertaste. I say obvious, when a Guinness has no aftertaste at all. But this is what a stout is supposed to be. I had no idea what to expect when pouring this into the glass, but I was impressed. I would totally order another one of these. This beer is DELICIOUS! Bottoms up people.\n",

Chocolate covered cherrys with vanilla frosting. The barrel aging process definitely enhanced the aroma big time. Reminds me of a Tactical Nuclear Penguin with alot less alcohol. I really hope it tastes incredible too.\t\tTaste-So I haven't had many barrel aged beers, but are they all this good? When sipping the stout out of the claret you just smell the bourbon and look forward for the taste. Big Oaky bourbon vanilla taste. Followed by some dark fruits and cherry.

Incredible balanced, but I need to give it a 4.5 to leave room for more Barrell Aged beers. \t\tMouthfeel-A tad bit thin and slightly watery which may be the only real negative about this beer. Medium bodied and a nice amount of carbonation.\t\tOverall-The fact that all this flavor comes out a 8% beer is amazing. Could definitely drink 3 or 4 of these in a sitting.

After a trip to a local beer store yielded a dozen different brews we brought this one back and cracked it open.\t\tA straw, slightly hazy yellow with moderate head and lacing.\t\tAroma is a bit of a mess... some high alcohols around a slightly buttery (?!) grainy pale malt, alcohol esters are only faintly fruity and Belgian to my nose. A bit of a hint of noble hop aroma, kind of earthy and a bit spicy. It's not bad, but it doesn't quite work together.\t\tTaste is rounded, but the buttery grain malt flavor really rolls over everything as a part of this, unfortunately. It's just barely letting any yeast character around.\t\tMouth is overfull, sticky and a bit heavy.\t\tThere's nothing awful or off-putting, but this was hustled through to go on to something else worth tasting.\t\tIt's a bit of a misnomer to consider this a Belgian Strong Pale in the Duvel tradition which this clearly is not attempting to be... rather, it fits into the Belgian tradition of not giving a flying fuck about style guidelines. It's a strong Belgian ale that happens to be pale. And not terribly exciting. And maybe with a diacetyl problem. That's all.\n",

      "Prior to this beer I had their Amber Waves Ale. It was surprising to me to see how similar these beers were. I had one in between so it wasn't exactly side-by-side, but I must say this is a hoppy APA. I like that.\t\tAppearance: served clear gold with an off-white head.\t\tSmell: It seemed hoppy for an APA. The nose is citrus and floral with a hint of sweet.\t\tTaste: Plenty of bitterness in the taste. Not huge in any characteristics but lead by bitterness (more than hop flavor) and balanced with a touch of malt. (No diacetyl sometimes found in the style).

      "Did this GO BAD?? - My wife\t\tClassic line. Some people tell stories in their reviews. I usually do not. However, I do need to relay this one t you. We were taking my son to camp today and on the radio they started talking about a Brewdog 18% ABV beer... My wife went nuts and commented that she had never heard of such a thing. I just chuckled knowing I had a couple World Wide Stouts at home.. (and a 120 Minute..) My wife loves big stouts.... By the way.\t\tLater I told her that we would share a stout tonight and she agreed... Little did she know what she was going to sample. I brought out the bottle and poured her a small sample. Yep she proclaimed... \"Did this go bad??\" After cracking up I explained the situation to her. She did drink that glass and took a bit more.\t\tAs for me, I enjoyed this even more than I had hoped. And I had high hopes.\t\tVery little head forms atop this deep brown to black beer. A spot or two of lace..\t\tAroma is sweet and of liquor. And I say liquor to mean stronger than an alcohol note. Wow. There is a depth to the sweet aroma that is intoxicating. It also signals what's to follow quite correctly.\t\tWow, is this sweet and complex. I don't like \"hot\" beers and while this has a lot of alcohol I don't find it \"hot\" More boozy and a sense of being a liqueur. I get some maple, vanilla, chocolate covered cherries. As it warms to room temp I get some coffee in the after taste and also some charcoal.\t\tSyrup thick and some graininess as well.\t\tA slow sipper and more of an after dinner drink vs. a beer. An experience for sure.\n",

      "A - Pours a bright head that dissipates of lacing and a little bit of lacing.\t\tS: Dry and hoppy and sweet and the taste is a slight hop bitterness is not a bit of hop flavor to it. The taste is medium body with a touch of banana and creamy and sweet malt and some bitterness. The malt sweet and finish is well as well. The flavor is some bitterness is strong and some sweetness that is a little bitter with a bit sweet and roasted malt and a bit of grapefruit and sweet and smooth and some sweetness and malt and floral sweetness that is a little to the background of the smell with a light bitterness is some sweetness. There is a slight sweet malt backbone that is not a bit of an ale. The beer has a well balanced with a bitter sweetness that is present and some finish. It is a bit of an amber color with a slight caramel and sweet malt stands of light and a little bitter pale ale. A decent hoppy and a bit of carbonation.

      "I thought Id hold out and sample Full Sails best selling new beer on draught at the Hood River brewery where its produced. But as I sat down at the bar in the newly remodeled taproom I noticed a small bucket full of Session bottle caps and the bartender informed me that the beer is only served in the 11-oz. stubby bottles, never on draught. They dont even pour it in a glass for you, but simply crack the bottle and hand it to you. \t\tIts been a mighty long time since Ive been served a beer like that. I ordinarily visit brewpubs to drink draught beers or at the very least, get a bottled beer served in a glass. So I had to smile at being caught off guard by the quaint old-school service. It seems Full Sail has taken the whole working mans session lager thing quite seriously. And it somehow seems appropriate. \t\tBear with me because Ive never, ever consumed a beer straight from the bottle for evaluative purposes. But if thats how the brewery intends it to be served, Im drinking this one straight from the bottle. \t\tSession lager is the color of a pale lager inside a brown bottle. That is to say, I have no idea what color it is. All I can surmise is that the beer appears reasonably clear, has low carbonation, and doesnt care to put forth a head. And the smell is well, the smell is stuck inside the bottle. And no matter how much I tried to coax the smell out or squeeze my nose in, I just couldnt connect.\t\tBy the way, the beer comes in a twist-off bottle but the bartender used a bottle opener. Score one for service. \t\tAfter indulging all the inverse hullabaloo of a genuine proletariat stubby of lager (reminiscent of Oly), the taste of Session was frankly a bit disappointing. Its actually just plain boring. Though it purports to be an all-malt beverage, all the classic shortcomings of an industrial macro lager are here in good measure  the wet-grass-in-a-blender taste with the drab, scowling finish. When I was eighteen I might have really enjoyed this beer. (While listening to an LP of Journey, no less.) But now that Im all grown up I like to drink good beer, and this aint it. \t\tHint: drink it before it warms and you wont have to taste it.\n",
      "A fad of the bottle into a pint glass. The body is a light body with a light beer to the straw color with a light brown with a slight haze and a light brown with a thin lace that leaves some sweet color with a minimal head that lingers of lacing.

The taste is sweet that is all the beer is a bit of the most refreshing and the flavor is a bit of the hops with a crisp and caramel and some flavor of the back of the back of moderate carbonation.

      "Poured from a 750ml bottle into my Chimay snifter. The front label (painted) had a cool design and the back label (also painted) had a story on who St. Vrain was and what went into the beer. Label also noted that was 2006 Bottle Conditioned. The color was a light golden/brass. The head was a foamy 1/4 inch that turned into a consistent thin top that remained throughout and was feed by a constant stream of bubbles from the bottom. The aroma was nice and malty with a spicy sweetness in there as well. It's listed at 9% ABV but it does not taste alcoholish unlike some Tripels that I've had recently - pretty well balanced. The taste is very good but not overpoweringly awesome like Allagash which is still my favorite and top rated Tripel. With that said, this is still top 3 for Tripels. As it warms the flavors develop even more and go nicely with the warming from the alcohol. Good creamy, bubbly mouthfeel as well. Highly recommend especially if you like the style. Another excellent offering from a great brewery. Will cellar a couple and try again as they age. (4.5, RR, T, Y)\n",

Pale malt taste with a hint of hops, not much lemon flavor, which in my opinion is good. A very light and crisp mouthfeel, very much like a lager.

      "22oz '07 vintage picked up sometime last week at the Boise Coop for a very reasonable $4.. poured into my New Belgium snifter.\t\tFairly aggressive poure produced a creamy looking 3 finger light tan head atop a very clear amber brew with cherry juice highlites... bunches of leopard spot lacing.\t\tVery assertive hop profile.. nose hair curling pine and citrus.. mildy floral... I know there are malts in there.. but wow.. This is my idea of a fresh American Barley Wine.\t\tPalate is ultra smooth despite being pummeled by the hops.. Not as heavy body as I remember in previous years and I am okay with that... big clingy hop resins.. more pine and citrus rind.. not alot of yeast fruitiness..but it is identifiable... lower carbonation helps add to the body.. toasty and caramel malts really only start showing up as it warms... only passing glances of chocolate.\t\tAnother very good vintage of the Boardhead... and I need to pick up quite a few more for the cellar.. I think it will only get better as the hops die down a tad and allow the malts to show through... but it is still very nice fresh from the brewery.\n",
