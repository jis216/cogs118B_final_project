Description of Files:

main.py:
  preprocess training and testing data. preprocessing is required for our training code to run.
  to preprocess training data, run 'python3 main.py gen-train'
  to preprocess testing data, run 'python3 main.py gen-test'

models.py:
  define LSTM and GRU models

configs.py:
  define settings for training and generating

dataloader:
  a custom dataloader for preprocessed data

train_gru.py & train_lstm.py:
  run training with configs

*_plot.ipynb:
  plot loss vs epoch for report

*_score.ipynb:
  generate test reviews and calculate BLEU _score

*_training.ipynb:
  experiment with different training settings.
